View the live demo
------------------

See the finished product in action at [FacebookSampleApp.com](http://facebooksampleapp.com/ "Scrumptious Web demo app")

Place files on your webserver
-----------------------------

Scrumptious Web requires a web server addressable from the public Internet running [PHP](http://www.php.net/) with [cURL enabled](http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.curl.php).

Clone the repository from GitHub into a folder inside your website's document root.

    git clone git@github.com:fbsamples/web-scrumptious.git scrumptious
    cd scrumptious

Initialize and update the [Facebook PHP SDK](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk) [submodule](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules "git submodules").

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

Configure your application
--------------------------

Edit the `config.php` file with the appropriate values for your application, audience, and server.

1. Add information from [your Facebook application](https://developers.facebook.com/apps "Facebook Developers site applications") including your app id, secret, and namespace.
1. Set your [Facebook locale](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/internationalization/ "Facebook internationalization") to display JavaScript SDK strings in a language other than English.
1. Specify a base URI, including the trailing slash, representing the URI to this directory's content on your webserver. e.g. `http://example.com/`
1. Specify a static base URI, including the trailing slash, representing the URI to the sample's static content. e.g. `http://example.com/static/` if on the same server or `http://s.example.com/` if you choose to serve static files from a CDN or separate hostname.

Scrumptious Web overview
---------------------------

Scrumptious Web allows a visitor to browse a list of meals and view a detail page with more information about a meal of interest.

Scrumptious Web paired with a properly configured Facebook application adds identity and sharing features powered by Facebook:

* Share [basic Facebook information](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/login/public-profile-and-friend-list/) with your Facebook application through [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/concepts/login/) including his or her name, gender, and Facebook profile photo
* Grant your Facebook application permission to publish new [Open Graph actions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/using-actions/) to his Facebook profile on his behalf
* Publish a new custom Open Graph action associated with your application with support for a [personal message](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/submission-process/opengraph/guidelines/action-properties/#usermessages "Facebook Open Graph action user messages"), [tagged friends](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/guides/tagging/#people "Facebook Open Graph action tagged friends"), [tagged place](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/guides/tagging/#places "Facebook Open Graph action tagged place"), and [explicit sharing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/guides/explicit-sharing/ "Facebook Open Graph action explicit sharing")
